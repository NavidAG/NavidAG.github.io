            <h2>Stamina - Bachelor's Thesis</h2>

            <p>Every Bachelor's student should undertake a project by the end of its last semester
              and that project, theoretically, is a representative of all the knowledge which the
              student has gained throughout its studies. Academic projects can be classified into
              two categories, research based and project based. Stamina lies under the project
              based category.</p>
            <h3 style="text-align: justify;">Abstract</h3>
            <p style="text-align: justify;">
              It cannot be denied that Covid 19 has had negative impacts on the way people
              exercise since many gyms and work-out sessions have been closed. Consequently, there
              has been an upward trend in the number of users who subscribe to weekly or seasonal
              training plans such as <a href="https://www.apple.com/apple-fitness-plus/">Apple
                Fitness+</a> or <a href="https://www.onepeloton.com">Peleton</a> which provide
              instructions using
              videos and voice assistants to ensure that users can follow them precisely. However,
              these services are unable to check if the user performs the actions accurately.
              Since there is no measurement that help ensure that they are not performing
              movements incorrectly, not only may users lose their motivation in continuing
              exercise activity, they may also end up with severe injuries in long term.
            </p>
            <h3 style="text-align: justify;">Pros and Cons of the services in the market</h3>
            <p style="text-align: justify;">
              There are many services that provide different procedures for work-out activities.
              <a href="https://tempo.fit">Tempo</a> is a service that introduces novel techniques
              for indoor work-out. It includes
              over a thousand of workout videos and provides guided work-out sessions by top
              professionals in different fields. The main selling point of this service is that it
              analyses user’s posture and actions in real-time and gives a detailed insight about
              the user’s performance. It also comes with lifting equipment that is recognized by
              the app. This app has a leaderboard which shows other users’ performances and
              encourages users to reach the top of the leaderboard. However, there are many
              reasons why this service is not reachable to many people. First of all, it requires
              users to pay for the service on either monthly or yearly basis, which is not ideal
              for many users. Moreover, in order to take advantage of the more sophisticated
              features of this application such as posture recognition, users should use high-end
              iPhones, more specifically, iPhones that are equipped with lidar sensors such as
              iPhone XS and iPhone XR. This is not feasible for large number of people, since most
              of the people use less advanced or older models of iPhones. More importantly, this
              service overlooks android users, which means that the people who own Android
              smartphones cannot use this service. Another alternative service is called <a
                href="https://www.exer.ai/plank">Plank</a>
              which is developed by Exer. This application is also able to examine user’s
              movements and presents voice feedbacks for guidance. The advantage of this service
              compared to previous one is that it does not need any additional hardware and it
              only uses phone’s built-in camera to proceed. However, it is only compatible with
              iOS devices such as iPhone and iPad. In other words, Android users cannot use the
              services and the application unless they afford an iOS device, which is not
              practical for many people.
            </p>
            <h3 style="text-align: justify;">Brief look at other studies</h3>
            <p style="text-align: justify;">
              We have investigated many other studies in which there are three types of feedback
              functions which ensure that beginners can make progress and stay motivated during
              training sessions. In one pilot study, OpenPose was used to detect necessary points
              to proceed the evaluation of squat postures. While the training posture should be
              automated, among different approaches regarding motion analysis OpenPose was chosen
              due to its ease of use and limitation in time, space and expenses. However, since
              only two-dimensional images are involved, some complicated movements may be ignored
              or compromised. That is why the position of the camera matters.
              Skelton is detected using OpenPose to evaluate human movement. Ideal posture is the
              one which receives the highest score as there are 4 parts of the body which are
              crucial in the measurement.
              Having given a score to different parts of the body, user can observe them as
              numbers.
              In video annotation, two types of feedbacks are suggested. Firstly, user can compare
              its training pictures with the instructor on the screen, secondly, the voice
              assistant can guide the user and let it know about its errors while performing.
              Photographing angle can affect the outcome. Based on an experiment, it is proved
              that some points may seem very similar to system whereas from another angle, the
              differences stand out.

              We do not want to limit movements to a specific training such as yoga or squat which
              some other studies did. Hence, we aim to generalise it to any activity which
              involves body posture. In other words, it can potentialy be used in military or
              dance classes.
            </p>
            <h3 style="text-align: justify;">⚡️Stamina</h3>
            <p style="text-align: justify;">
              We propose a system that can be used with any modern smartphone to analyze and
              detect errors. A trainer records the workout which is uploaded to a cloud service
              and main elements of the body are extracted by the cloud service. Unlike mentioned
              services in the previous section, our app is compatible with a large proportion of
              the smartphones and tablets and it is not limited to a certain platform. There are
              several scenarios in which the user can examine the movements.

              The user can create a workout session in which he/she defines and labels that
              session. Next, the user is required to upload a video of that activity which is used
              as a reference video. To get the most out of this algorithm, the reference video
              should be a clip of a professional whose movements would meet the criteria of
              correct movements. Afterwards, the user can record a short video of themselves while
              performing the movements. At this point, the user would eventually stop recording
              and upload the video to the server. Then, the server will return an analyzed and
              processed video of the user’s actions and this is the stage where the user can see
              how much his movements have been aligned with the reference video. This process can
              be repeated many times and the app projects the progress of the user into a chart to
              visualize the progress. The figures are shown in chronological order and the user
              can monitor its development. The advantage of this design is that the user can
              simultaneously monitor its progress in different exercises by creating different
              exercise sessions. Every session has its dedicated reference video and chart.

              Although Stamina is an academic project, it was one of the most complex project that
              has ever done by the United Twins Team, since the team was responsible for all of
              the stages of the development, from initial ideas and design to validation and
              implementation. The design process was not limited to the code base and it included
              every component of the application i.e. database design, system architecture and
              etc.
            </p>
            <h3 style="text-align: justify;">Deeper Look at ⚡️Stamina</h3>
            <p style="text-align: justify;">
              It starts with a login page. Users can either create a new account or log in,
              provided they have made an account before. The advantage of having account in this
              app is that the user can restore its progress and never lose its data. This feature
              is useful when user wants to switch its device or more than one person is using the
              app. With the consent of the user, this app creates a backup from the user's data
              and restore that backup whenever the user logs in in any device.

            <br>
            <p style="text-align: justify;">
              After successfully completing the authentication stage, the dashboard page is shown.
              This page contains all of the workout categories that have been instantiated by the
              user or are to be instantiated. These categories contain reference images that would
              be compared to user's movements. User can also remove those categories.

            <p style="text-align: justify;">
              Upon creating a new session, the user should set a name for the session, after which
              it should set reference images that can be either chosen from the predefined images
              in the application or selected from the library of the phone.

            <br>
            <p style="text-align: justify;">
              In the next stage, the user can upload the test images that represent the movement
              of itself. Then, photos would be uploaded and it analyzed by the API. User can now
              get to know its performance by the number of error points which are shown as red
              dots in the annonated image. If user uploads another test images set, it would not
              override its previous data. It would add another data which helps the user to see
              its performance nd progress throughout the time. The data is visualised using
              interactive charts that indicate the overall progress of the user, as well as its
              performance in each frame.
