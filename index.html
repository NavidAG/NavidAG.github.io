                                    learners.

                                    We live in a world where learning another language,
                                    especially English is vital.
                                    Magic Cards 1 is a fun, ad-free and interactive app. Practice reading, listening,
                                    and writing to build your vocabulary skills.
                                    Designed by people who have studied the English when they were at the age of ten or
                                    so. Therefore, all the features are built based on the materials that a child needs.
                                    In other words, this app is designed by the RIGHT people.

                                    We collected more than 1000 useful words and vocabularies that children should know
                                    in the first place. These handy vocabularies would help your child develop a robust
                                    learning curve for learning English. Having this complete collection in mind, we
                                    designed a unified dictionary which allows you to search for the word, see the
                                    definition in picture, listen to the pronunciation and of course, add it to your
                                    favorites/bookmarks. This app is one of the eight apps that we are developing. Once
                                    your child learned all of the words in this app, he/she can download the next-level
                                    vocabularies app (Magic Cards 2) that we would make it available in the near future.

                                    Our developers have classified the vocabularies by the category. By choosing a
                                    category, you would be prompted with the flash-card page. It allows your child to
                                    review the worlds and there are three progress bars which show the following
                                    information:
                                    </br>
                                    how many words your child knows.
                                    </br>
                                    how many worlds he/she is reviewing right now.
                                    </br>
                                    how many words are in the learning process.
                                    </br>
                                    </br>
                                    It’s the best practice for your child to examine what he/she has learned. So we
                                    designed interactive challenges get a feedback of your child. By taking these
                                    challenges, he/she will find out what his/her mistakes are. He/she can get back to
                                    flash-cards and practice again. The process of going back and forth between these
                                    two stages would reduce the possibility of forgetting the vocabularies. We have also
                                    implemented feature in which you can share the your child’s progress with his/her
                                    teacher. He/She can share the progress with his/her friends.
                                    </br></br>
                                    Express your character by choosing your favorite color that would be set as the
                                    primary theme of the app.

                                    consultant and the folks who want to stay fit.</p>
                                <img class="img-fluid d-block mx-auto" src="assets/img/portfolio/2.jpg" alt="..." />
                                <p style="text-align: justify;">The very first year of the university was over and by
                                    that time, we’d had learned the
                                    fundamental concepts of programming and object oriented thinking. To put our
                                    knowledge into the practice, we joined a company that was aiming to release a
                                    diet-based application at the time. We were a group of 5 computer engineering
                                    students which had zero experience
                                    in working at the industry. Here are the challenges we confronted and ultimately,
                                    solved during
                                    a course of three months:
                                    </br>
                                    1. By that time, we hadn’t really worked on a real project that’s going to be used
                                    by a large number of people.
                                    </br>

                                    2. Our employer had asked us to develop and design this application with the Flutter
                                    framework. At the time, flutter hasn’t been released for the mass production and it
                                    was still in the beta phase just for the developers and the enthusiasts. Being one
                                    of the early adapters of a new programming languages means that we have to solve our
                                    problem by ourselves or at the worst scenario, ask it from the community. However,
                                    of course, there’s a real lack of information in the forums since the community is
                                    still under the development. Therefore, we had to have a R&D team dedicated to
                                    solving the problems and looking for the best implementations.

                                    Ali took the leadership of the group. Mohsen and Ali (this is another Ali :) ) took
                                    the
                                    programming part of the project. Navid and Saeed were not only responsible for
                                    programming and engineering of the app, they also contributed to the R&D of the
                                    team. The result was a mobile app ready to be shipped to the customers and all that
                                    took was only 3 months. After the app was successfully released, Navid and Saeed
                                    left the company to pursue their own project with the experience they’d gained.

                                    It cannot be denied that Covid 19 has had negative impacts on the way people
                                    exercise since many gyms and work-out sessions have been closed. Consequently, there
                                    has been an upward trend in the number of users who subscribe to weekly or seasonal
                                    training plans such as <a href="https://www.apple.com/apple-fitness-plus/">Apple
                                        Fitness+</a> or <a href="https://www.onepeloton.com">Peleton</a> which provide
                                    instructions using
                                    videos and voice assistants to ensure that users can follow them precisely. However,
                                    these services are unable to check if the user performs the actions accurately.
                                    Since there is no measurement that help ensure that they are not performing
                                    movements incorrectly, not only may users lose their motivation in continuing
                                    exercise activity, they may also end up with severe injuries in long term.
                                </p>
                                <h3 style="text-align: justify;">Pros and Cons of the services in the market</h3>
                                <p style="text-align: justify;">
                                    There are many services that provide different procedures for work-out activities.
                                    <a href="https://tempo.fit">Tempo</a> is a service that introduces novel techniques
                                    for indoor work-out. It includes
                                    over a thousand of workout videos and provides guided work-out sessions by top
                                    professionals in different fields. The main selling point of this service is that it
                                    analyses user’s posture and actions in real-time and gives a detailed insight about
                                    the user’s performance. It also comes with lifting equipment that is recognized by
                                    the app. This app has a leaderboard which shows other users’ performances and
                                    encourages users to reach the top of the leaderboard. However, there are many
                                    reasons why this service is not reachable to many people. First of all, it requires
                                    users to pay for the service on either monthly or yearly basis, which is not ideal
                                    for many users. Moreover, in order to take advantage of the more sophisticated
                                    features of this application such as posture recognition, users should use high-end
                                    iPhones, more specifically, iPhones that are equipped with lidar sensors such as
                                    iPhone XS and iPhone XR. This is not feasible for large number of people, since most
                                    of the people use less advanced or older models of iPhones. More importantly, this
                                    service overlooks android users, which means that the people who own Android
                                    smartphones cannot use this service. Another alternative service is called <a
                                        href="https://www.exer.ai/plank">Plank</a>
                                    which is developed by Exer. This application is also able to examine user’s
                                    movements and presents voice feedbacks for guidance. The advantage of this service
                                    compared to previous one is that it does not need any additional hardware and it
                                    only uses phone’s built-in camera to proceed. However, it is only compatible with
                                    iOS devices such as iPhone and iPad. In other words, Android users cannot use the
                                    services and the application unless they afford an iOS device, which is not
                                    practical for many people.

                                <h3 style="text-align: justify;">Brief look at other studies</h3>
                                <p style="text-align: justify;">
                                    We have investigated many other studies in which there are three types of feedback
                                    functions which ensure that beginners can make progress and stay motivated during
                                    training sessions. In one pilot study, OpenPose was used to detect necessary points
                                    to proceed the evaluation of squat postures. While the training posture should be
                                    automated, among different approaches regarding motion analysis OpenPose was chosen
                                    due to its ease of use and limitation in time, space and expenses. However, since
                                    only two-dimensional images are involved, some complicated movements may be ignored
                                    or compromised. That is why the position of the camera matters.
                                    Skelton is detected using OpenPose to evaluate human movement. Ideal posture is the
                                    one which receives the highest score as there are 4 parts of the body which are
                                    crucial in the measurement.
                                    Having given a score to different parts of the body, user can observe them as
                                    numbers.
                                    In video annotation, two types of feedbacks are suggested. Firstly, user can compare
                                    its training pictures with the instructor on the screen, secondly, the voice
                                    assistant can guide the user and let it know about its errors while performing.
                                    Photographing angle can affect the outcome. Based on an experiment, it is proved
                                    that some points may seem very similar to system whereas from another angle, the
                                    differences stand out.

                                    We do not want to limit movements to a specific training such as yoga or squat which
                                    some other studies did. Hence, we aim to generalise it to any activity which
                                    involves body posture. In other words, it can potentialy be used in military or
                                    dance classes.

                                <p style="text-align: justify;">
                                    We propose a system that can be used with any modern smartphone to analyze and
                                    detect errors. A trainer records the workout which is uploaded to a cloud service
                                    and main elements of the body are extracted by the cloud service. Unlike mentioned
                                    services in the previous section, our app is compatible with a large proportion of
                                    the smartphones and tablets and it is not limited to a certain platform. There are
                                    several scenarios in which the user can examine the movements.

                                    The user can create a workout session in which he/she defines and labels that
                                    session. Next, the user is required to upload a video of that activity which is used
                                    as a reference video. To get the most out of this algorithm, the reference video
                                    should be a clip of a professional whose movements would meet the criteria of
                                    correct movements. Afterwards, the user can record a short video of themselves while
                                    performing the movements. At this point, the user would eventually stop recording
                                    and upload the video to the server. Then, the server will return an analyzed and
                                    processed video of the user’s actions and this is the stage where the user can see
                                    how much his movements have been aligned with the reference video. This process can
                                    be repeated many times and the app projects the progress of the user into a chart to
                                    visualize the progress. The figures are shown in chronological order and the user
                                    can monitor its development. The advantage of this design is that the user can
                                    simultaneously monitor its progress in different exercises by creating different
                                    exercise sessions. Every session has its dedicated reference video and chart.

                                    Although Stamina is an academic project, it was one of the most complex project that
                                    has ever done by the United Twins Team, since the team was responsible for all of
                                    the stages of the development, from initial ideas and design to validation and
                                    implementation. The design process was not limited to the code base and it included
                                    every component of the application i.e. database design, system architecture and
                                    etc.

                                    It starts with a login page. Users can either create a new account or log in,
                                    provided they have made an account before. The advantage of having account in this
                                    app is that the user can restore its progress and never lose its data. This feature
                                    is useful when user wants to switch its device or more than one person is using the

                                    be compared to user's movements. User can also remove those categories.

                                    In the next stage, the user can upload the test images that represent the movement
                                    of itself. Then, photos would be uploaded and it analyzed by the API. User can now
                                    get to know its performance by the number of error points which are shown as red
                                    dots in the annonated image. If user uploads another test images set, it would not
                                    override its previous data. It would add another data which helps the user to see
                                    its performance nd progress throughout the time. The data is visualised using
                                    interactive charts that indicate the overall progress of the user, as well as its
                                    performance in each frame.
